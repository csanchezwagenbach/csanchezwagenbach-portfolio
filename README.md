# csanchezwagenbach-portfolio

## Description
This portfolio webpage is intended to be a home for my incipient career as a programmer. This portfolio will hold projects I have completed as well as information about my person and how I might be contacted. Throughout the project, much practice was afforded with the constructin of both an HTML and CSS stylesheet form scratch. While attaining much more confidence with the generation of HTML, this project brought home to bear growth areas still to be pursued with respect to the fluent use of CSS. 

Site is now live and visible [here.](https://csanchezwagenbach.github.io/csanchezwagenbach-portfolio/)
